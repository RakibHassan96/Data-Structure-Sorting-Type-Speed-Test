# Sorting Type Speed Test

HOW ARE WE RUNNING THE TEST?

1.Sort array of size 10,000 using bubble sort and record elapsed time

2.Increment element number by 2,500 until 100,000 elements is reached and record elapsed time value each time

3.Repeat steps 1-2, but with selection sort and insertion sort

4.Repeat steps 1-3 with different seed number to ensure validity of data
